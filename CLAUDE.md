## Architecture Guidelines

### Admin UI State Management

The admin UI (`src/server/admin.html`) uses two complementary state management patterns:

#### 1. URL-based State Management
See `@docs/url-state-management.md` for detailed documentation.

- Navigation state (tabs, views) is stored in URL parameters
- Enables shareable URLs, browser history, and bookmarking
- Example: `?tab=providers&view=add`

#### 2. LocalStorage-based State Management
See `@docs/localstorage-state-management.md` for detailed documentation.

**Critical Architecture Decision**: The server loads TOML config on startup and **does not reload until restart**. Therefore:

- ✅ **Correct**: Use localStorage as client-side cache
  - Page load: Fetch from server → save to localStorage
  - All operations (add/delete/edit): Update localStorage only
  - "저장" button: Sync localStorage → server
  - "저장 & 재시작" button: Sync → restart server

- ❌ **Wrong**: Fetch from server after each operation
  - Server returns stale data until restart
  - Causes inconsistent UI state

**Key Functions**:
- `loadConfig()` - Fetch from server (only on page load)
- `saveToLocalStorage(config)` - Save to localStorage
- `syncToServer()` - Sync localStorage to server (only called by save buttons)
- All CRUD operations update localStorage only, then call `saveToLocalStorage()`

**When modifying admin UI**:
1. Never add server fetches in CRUD operations
2. All operations must update `appState.config` → `saveToLocalStorage()`
3. Only save buttons call `syncToServer()`
4. Always notify user: "(저장 버튼을 눌러 적용하세요)"

<!-- code-review-graph MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
| ------ | ---------- |
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
